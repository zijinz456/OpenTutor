"""BFS recursive URL crawler — core primitives (§14.5 v2.5 T1).

Scope of this module (architect defaults):
- **Same-origin filter ON by default** (F2): only URLs sharing the seed's
  ``(scheme, netloc)`` are followed. ``path_prefix`` is an optional further
  constraint so ``docs.python.org/3/tutorial/`` does not drag in
  ``/3/library/`` blog feeds.
- **Stdlib-only HTTP via ``httpx.AsyncClient``** (F3): no Playwright, no
  Scrapling. Crawl-tier pages are by definition cheap HTML; heavy fallbacks
  belong to the per-page ingestion pipeline, not the crawler.
- **No robots.txt, no rate-limit, no DB writes** — those are T2/T3 scope.
- **Never raises on fetch failure** — yields ``status="fetch_fail"`` so the
  caller can decide its own logging/accounting policy.

Canonicalization strips ``utm_*``, ``fbclid``, ``gclid``, session query
params, and URL fragments; lowercases the host; sorts remaining query
params so ``?b=1&a=2`` and ``?a=2&b=1`` hash identically.
